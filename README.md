Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal state, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is crucial for providing suitable treatment and preventing the disease from progressing. It can also aid researchers and clinicians to identify early biomarkers and minister new treatments that have been a subject of extensive research. The application of deep learning techniques on structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has shown promising results in diagnosing the disease. In this project, we intend to introduce a novel approach of using an ensemble of the self-attention-based Bottleneck Transformers with a sharpness aware minimizer for early detection of Alzheimer's Disease. The proposed approach has been tested on the widely accepted ADNI dataset and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score as the performance metrics.
